# Week 3

### Labs

In the labs this week, we completed several foundational activities to familiarise ourselves with Arduino and basic electronics:

- **Lab 1:** **LED Blink**  
  First up was the classic LED blink project. I set up my circuit on a breadboard, and when I uploaded my first sketch - seeing the LED light up and blink according to my code was so rewarding! It felt like magic, and I couldn't help but smile at my tiny victory.

- **Lab 2:** **Button and LED**  
  Next, we moved on to connecting a button to control the LED. This was where things started to feel a bit more interactive. I remember the thrill of pressing the button and seeing the LED respond. It was such a simple action, but it made me realize how intuitive interaction design can be. This project made me excited about the possibilities of creating more engaging experiences in the future!

- **Lab Activity 3:** **Analog Input with Potentiometer**  
  We experimented with a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED. This was my favorite part because it visually demonstrated how analog signals can affect outputs, giving me a deeper appreciation for responsive design. Adjusting the potentiometer felt satisfying, as I could directly manipulate the light intensity. It emphasized how small changes in input can have significant impacts on the output, which is a crucial concept in design.

### Reading & Reflections

This week, my readings profoundly shaped my understanding of material choices and design context in my creative practice. _An Introduction to Discard Studies_ highlighted how the act of discarding materials can perpetuate societal inequalities, prompting me to reflect on how my material selections might affect project accessibility. _Creative Upcycling_ inspired me to consider repurposing old electronics, emphasizing the importance of making technology both accessible and environmentally sustainable. Meanwhile, _The Psychology of Data Visualization_ underscored the impact of design decisions on data perception, which I plan to incorporate into my project visualizations. Collectively, these insights have deepened my awareness of the interconnectedness between materials, social responsibility, and effective design, and I am eager to apply them in my future work.

### Project Development

For my mid-term project, I am considering remixing a simple animatronic face project. This week, I started brainstorming how I could use recycled materials for the face structure. Iâ€™m interested in incorporating sensors to create a more interactive experience, and I want to ensure that my design is both functional and sustainable
