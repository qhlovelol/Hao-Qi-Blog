# Week 1

### Labs

In the labs this week, we completed several foundational activities to familiarise ourselves with Arduino and basic electronics:

- **Lab 1:** **LED Blink**  
  First up was the classic LED blink project. I set up my circuit on a breadboard, and when I uploaded my first sketch - seeing the LED light up and blink according to my code was so rewarding! It felt like magic, and I couldn't help but smile at my tiny victory.

- **Lab 2:** **Button and LED**  
  Next, we moved on to connecting a button to control the LED. This was where things started to feel a bit more interactive. I remember the thrill of pressing the button and seeing the LED respond. It was such a simple action, but it made me realize how intuitive interaction design can be. This project made me excited about the possibilities of creating more engaging experiences in the future!

- **Lab Activity 3:** **Analog Input with Potentiometer**  
  We experimented with a potentiometer to control the brightness of an LED. This was my favorite part because it visually demonstrated how analog signals can affect outputs, giving me a deeper appreciation for responsive design. Adjusting the potentiometer felt satisfying, as I could directly manipulate the light intensity. It emphasized how small changes in input can have significant impacts on the output, which is a crucial concept in design.
