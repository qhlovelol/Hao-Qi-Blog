# Week 8

As I progress with my sound toy project, I’m excited to share the latest updates with just two weeks until submission. This past week has been dedicated to refining my prototype and preparing for the playtesting demo scheduled for next week. My goal remains to create an interactive toy that encourages users to explore sound through touch and movement, and I’m eager to see how it resonates with testers.

#### Development Process

**1. Prototype Refinement**  
After receiving feedback from initial testing, I revisited my cardboard prototype to make adjustments based on user interactions. I aimed to enhance its ergonomics and accessibility, ensuring that it is comfortable and inviting to use.

**2. Circuit Optimization**  
With my design in mind, I optimized the circuit setup. I revisited the breadboard assembly to ensure all connections were secure and to reduce noise interference in the sound output.

**3. Sound Quality Enhancement**  
I spent considerable time refining the audio quality from the DFPlayer Mini. By adjusting the playback settings and experimenting with different speakers, I was able to enhance the clarity and volume of the sounds.

**4. User Testing Preparation**  
To prepare for the upcoming playtesting demo, I developed a structured testing plan. I created a set of questions to guide feedback and focused on specific areas such as ease of use, sound diversity, and overall engagement.

#### Reflections
This week has been incredibly productive as I refine my sound toy project. I’ve learned a lot about the importance of iteration and user feedback in the development process. With playtesting just around the corner, I’m excited to gather insights from my peers that will further enhance the toy's design and functionality. My focus is now on creating an engaging and intuitive experience for users, ensuring that the toy meets their needs and expectations.

#### Next Steps
In preparation for next week’s playtesting demo, I plan to:
- **Finalize the prototype assembly** and ensure everything is functioning correctly.
- **Conduct the playtesting demo**, gathering feedback to make final adjustments.
- **Reflect on the feedback received** to prepare for the final submission.

I’m looking forward to sharing the results of the playtesting and seeing how my sound toy continues to evolve!
